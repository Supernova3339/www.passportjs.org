# Requesting Authorization

The OAuth 2.0 protocol flow begins when the application requests authorization
from the user.  The authorization request is typically triggered based on the
user taking an action.  In the case of Facebook, such an action would be the
user clicking the "Log In with Facebook" button.

For example, when the user clicks the following button:

```html
<a class="button" href="/login/federated/facebook">Log In with Facebook</a>
```

The user's web browser makes a request to the application:

```http
GET /login/federated/facebook HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
```

This request is handled by a route in the application:

```js
router.get('/login/federated/facebook', passport.authenticate('facebook'));
```

The route invokes Passport, and in particular the [`passport-oauth2`](https://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-oauth2/)
strategy, which responds by redirecting the user's web browser to Facebook:

```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://www.facebook.com/v3.2/dialog/oauth?response_type=code&client_id=3087198538966924&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com%2Foauth2%2Fredirect%2Ffacebook&state=ar75nSeG
```

The web browser follows this redirect and makes a request to Facebook:

```http
GET /v3.2/dialog/oauth?response_type=code&client_id=3087198538966924&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.example.com%2Foauth2%2Fredirect%2Ffacebook&state=ar75nSeG HTTP/1.1
Host: www.facebook.com
```

This request to Facebook (the authorization server) is an _authorization
request_.  The request is sent to the authorization server's _authorization
endpoint_ (`/v3.2/dialog/oauth`, in the case of Facebook).  Let's examine the
parameters in this request.

  * `response_type`: Indicates the type of grant desired from the authorization
      server's response.  The value `code` indicates that an authorization code
      is desired, which is used by server-side web applications.
      
      Recall that OAuth 2.0 is a framework.  Other response types are available
      that support other types of applications.  New types can be defined by
      extensions to OAuth 2.0.  This guide explains OAuth 2.0 as used by
      server-side web applications, so details of other response types are not
      examined.
      
      The authorization code response is the first step in a larger
      authorization code flow.  It will be paired with the later step of
      exchanging the code for an access token.
      
  * `client_id`: Identifies the application to the authorization server.  This
      is assigned when registering the application with Facebook.
      
  * `redirect_uri`: URL to which the authorization server will redirect the user
      after completing interaction with the user.
      
  * `state`: A value used by the application to maintain state between the
      redirects to the authorization server and back to the application.
      Passport adds this automatically to prevent cross-site request forgery
      (CSRF) attacks.
      

At this point, Facebook will interact with the user.  This interaction will
typically involve logging the user in (if they are not already logged in) and
obtaining their consent (if it has not been previously obtained).  Once that
has been completed, Facebook redirects the user back to the application with
an authorization code:

```http
HTTP/1.1 302 Found
Location: https://www.example.com/oauth2/redirect/facebook?code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA&state=ar75nSeG
```

The web browser follows this redirect and makes a request to the application:

```http
GET /oauth2/redirect/facebook?code=SplxlOBeZQQYbYS6WxSbIA&state=ar75nSeG HTTP/1.1
Host: www.example.com
```

This request to the application is an _authorization response_.  The request is
sent to the application's _redirection endpoint_ (`/oauth2/redirect/facebook`,
in this case), which corresponds to the value of the `redirect_uri` parameter in
the authorization request.  This endpoint is often also referred to as a
callback URL, as it was known in the earlier OAuth 1.0 protocol.  Let's examine
the parameters in this request.

  * `code`: The authorization code generated by the authorization server.
  
  * `state`: The value sent by the application in the authorization request.
  

This request is handled by a route in the application:

```js
router.get('/oauth2/redirect/facebook', passport.authenticate('facebook', {
  successReturnToOrRedirect: '/',
  failureRedirect: '/login'
}));
```

This route invokes Passport, and in particular the [`passport-oauth2`](https://www.passportjs.org/packages/passport-oauth2/)
strategy.  The strategy first verifies the validity of the `state` parameter to
prevent CSRF attacks.  It then [exchanges the authorization code for an access
token](../token/).
