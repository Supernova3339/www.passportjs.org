OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables an application to obtain
access to an API.  This access is granted with the consent of the user whose
information is protected by the API.  Once granted, the application can then use
the API to read, create, and/or modify information that the user has permitted
the application to access.

OAuth 2.0 can appear quite mysterious to developers, especially to those not
familiar with implementing security-related functionality.  Even identity
experts acknowledge the complexities of OAuth 2.0 and how it is used to provide
authentication and authorization functionality.

Fortunately, Passport makes it easy to integrate OAuth 2.0 without having to
know the underlying details of the protocol.  While this allows developers to
quickly add authentication and authorization to an application, it can also seem
like "magic" and enhance the mystery.

This guide provides an overview of OAuth 2.0 and analyzes how the protocol
operates.  It details how Passport works when implementing OAuth 2.0-based
authentication and authorization.  This guide will help demystify OAuth 2.0,
giving you a better understanding of how it works in your application.
