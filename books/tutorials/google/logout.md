# Log Out

In the [previous section](../session/), you established a login session after
the user signed in with Google.  In this section, you'll add sign out which will
terminate the session.

Open `routes/auth.js` and add the following route at line 72, below the
`/oauth2/redirect/google` route:

```js
router.post('/logout', function(req, res, next) {
  req.logout(function(err) {
    if (err) { return next(err); }
    res.redirect('/');
  });
});
```

Return to the app, where you should already be signed in, and click "Sign out."

You have built an app that allows users to sign in and sign out!
